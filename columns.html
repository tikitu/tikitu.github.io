<p>So the answer to your question was &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;. In
particular, it depends what the logical relationship between the columns
is: separate parallel narrative threads, or one thread to be read
left-column-then-right-column. This becomes important when a page break
appears inside the double-column section, which is gonna happen someday
with an e-edition because you've got no control over the size of the
device someone is reading on (hence no control over page sizes and page
breaks).</p>

<p>It's easy enough to make two <em>parallel</em> columns, following two
different narrative threads.</p>

<section class="left first">
    <p>Here is one thread. It goes on and on and on and on. And on and on
    and on.
    </p>
    <p>It contains two paragraphs, but eventually it stops.</p>
</section>

<section class="right second">
    <p>Here is the other thread. It, too, goes on at some length: about the
    same, not by chance.
    </p>
    <p>It, too, contains two paragraphs. And it, too, comes to an end.</p>
</section>

<p>This works, more or less, because I wrote the two columns to have
roughly the same length. If this is what you're doing: no worries at all.</p>

<p>This should also work fine with page breaks, I believe: you'll get
something looking like the following (although of course I'm faking it
here):</p>


<section class="left first">
    <p>Here is one thread. It goes on and on and on and on. And on and on
    and on.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="right second">
    <p>Here is the other thread. It, too, goes on at some length: about the
    same, not by chance.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="left first">
    <p>It contains two paragraphs, but eventually it stops.</p>
</section>

<section class="right second">
    <p>It, too, contains two paragraphs. And it, too, comes to an end.</p>
</section>

<p>The page break needn't fall on a paragraph boundary either, that's just
to make faking it easier for me.</p>

<p>So that's the easy option. The tricky one looks like this:</p>

<section class="left first">
    <p>Here starts a narrative thread that should continue across
    <em>both</em> columns. It goes on and on from left to
    right,</p>
</section>

<section class="right second">
    <p>continuing here where it left off
    there. You get the general idea. Balanced text flowing across columns.</p>
</section>

<p>This is still roughly achievable if the entire chunk falls on the same
page. The ways I know to do it involve running javascript, which is fine
for a website but probably not ok for an ebook. But if you know the font
measurements you can decide where to break the columns yourself; if you're
wrong about the font measurements (e.g. if someone set a non-standard font
on their ebook reader) the column ends will look a bit ragged but it's not
a disaster.</p>

<p>(If what you're setting happens to be structured like poetry, with
fixed line-breaks, you've got no problems at all. Except if the viewing
screen is so narrow that it has to wrap/break the lines you've got:
in general something to beware of with multicolumn layouts, lots of people
reading on phones these days.)</p>

<p>The disaster comes if this gets a page-break intervening. Because you
want to get this:</p>

<section class="left first">
    <p>Here starts a narrative thread that should continue</p>
    </section>
<section class="right first">
    <p>
    across <em>both</em> columns. It goes on and on from left to
    right,</p>
</section>

<section class="left second">
    <p>continuing here where it left off there. I guess you get the
    </p>
    </section>
<section class="right second">
    <p>general idea. Balanced text flowing across columns.</p>
</section>

<p>But what you'll actually get is this:</p>

<section class="left first">
    <p>Here starts a narrative thread that should continue</p>
    </section>
<section class="right second">
    <p>continuing here where it left off
    there. You get the general
    </p>
    </section>

<section class="left first">
    <p>across
    <em>both</em> columns. It goes on and on from left to
    right,</p>
</section>
<section class="right second">
<p>idea. Balanced text flowing across columns.</p>
</section>

<p>You have to read to the bottom of the left column (which
continues on the next page!) before starting on the right column.
&ldquo;Suboptimal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I should stress, though, that this ain't my day job: folk who make ebooks must
have <em>some</em> way to produce more complex layouts. It's just gonna be a
whole lot harder than simply dropping the text into a standard template, which
might mean it's not cost-effective for a publisher to even try.
